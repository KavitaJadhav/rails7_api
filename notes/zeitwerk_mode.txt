Zeitwerk - code loader engine(introduced in rails 6) - older classic

Applications would only run in the Zeitwerk mode.

Zeitwerk is an efficient and thread-safe code loader for Ruby.
Given a conventional file structure, Zeitwerk is able to load your project's classes and modules on demand (autoloading), or upfront (eager loading).

Just like classic, Zeitwerk provides the features of code autoloading, eager loading, and reloading.
However, while classic mode relies on the const_missing callback for loading files, Zeitwerk uses Rubyâ€™s native Module#autoload method.

Disable Zeitwerk mode - config.autoloader = :classic in your application.rb.

zeitwerk is a seperate gem which can be included in non rails applications


classic mode - it raise const_missing method , const_missing method of ruby is overwritten in Rails to call Module.autoload method
Zeitwerk mode - it refers to autoload_path, ad mapping for all constants, when new class added it checks mapping, if missing call Module#autolad method directly
