1. bin/rails credentials:edit  - This command will create the credentials file if it does not exist. Additionally, this command will create config/master.key if no master key is defined.Secrets kept in the credentials file are accessible via Rails.application.credentials. For example, with the following decrypted config/credentials.yml.enc

2. bin/rails db:encryption:init -
Add this entry to the credentials of the target environment:

active_record_encryption:
  primary_key: EGY8WhulUOXixybod7ZWwMIL68R9o5kC
  deterministic_key: aPA5XyALhf75NNnMzaspW7akTfZp0lPY
  key_derivation_salt: xEY0dt6TZcAMg52K7O84wYzkjvbA62Hz

By default encryption is non-deterministic, same values will have different encrypted values
Set deterministic: true to use same encrypted string for same value. It will allow querying data

downcase: true - set to downcase original value and encrypt - eg. email
ignore_case: true - This will persist original value. the content with the original case will be stored in the column `original_name`.

config.active_record.encryption.support_unencrypted_data - to Support migrated unencrypted data

keys rotation - i will start decryption with latest key and wil keep decrypting until value retrieve


deterministic: true, previous: { deterministic: false } - if type changed in between, add previous type to support old values

additionally, it provide capability to generate custom keys, using custom key for single model

can use encrypt, decrypt methods with class instances
