Rails Active Storage was introduced in Rails 5.2
Before that Paperclip / carrierwave gems were used to integrate static content

Active Storage Setup:
1. rails active_storage:install

It creates 3 tables in DB:
1. active_storage_blobs - file_name, content_type, metadata, checksum(represent stored file)
2. active_storage_attachments - blob_id, file, record_id, record_type - Polymorphic table. connection between model table and blob
3. active_storage_variant_records - blob_id, variation_digest - store variant information

Attach image from rails console:
# user = User.last
# user.profile_pic.attach(io: File.open("./Kavita.jpeg"), filename: "Kavita.jpeg")
